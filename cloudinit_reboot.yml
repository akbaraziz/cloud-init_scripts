#cloud-final

## poweroff or reboot system after finished
# default: none
#
# power_state can be used to make the system shutdown, reboot or
# halt after boot is finished. This same thing can be acheived by
# user-data scripts or by runcmd by simply invoking 'shutdown'.
#
# Doing it this way ensures that cloud-init is entirely finished with
# modules that would be executed, and avoids any error/log messages
# that may go to the console as a result of system services like
# syslog being taken down while cloud-init is running.
